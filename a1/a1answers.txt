% 7. Suppose for sliding a tile to the left we would change the
% cost from 1 to 0.5 and leave all the other moves the same cost.
% Does this affect the admissibility of the heuristics? Which of
% them are admissible now?


%%  - hfn_null
<7.1.1>
yes

<7.1.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]


%%  - hfn_misplaced
<7.2.1>
no

<7.2.2>
Consider a state n of a (N = 8) puzzle where the first two rows are in correct order, but the
last two numbers (7,8) in the last row are together on the bottom righ corner with the blank 
in the bottom left.

In this case, hfn_misplaced(n) = 2. 

The optimal solution is to move 7 left then 8 left which will cost 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.
Since the heuristic overestimated the cost to the optimal solution, it's not admissible.


%%  - hfn_manhattan
<7.3.1>
no

<7.3.2>
Consider a state n of a (N = 8) puzzle where the first two rows are in correct order, but the
last two numbers (7,8) in the last row are together on the bottom righ corner with the blank 
in the bottom left.

In this case, hfn_manhattan(n) = 2. 

The optimal solution is to move 7 left then 8 left which will cost 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.
Since the heuristic overestimated the cost to the optimal solution, it's not admissible.



%%  - hfn_inversions
<7.4.1>
no

<7.4.2>
Consider the following state n of a (N = 8) puzzle:

		____________
		|   |   |   |
		|_1_|_2_|_3_|
		|   |	|   |
		|_4_|_8_|_5_|
		|   |	|   |
		|_7_|___|_6_|
		
The optimal solution is 8 down , 5 left, 6 up, giving a total cost of 1 + 0.5 + 1 = 2.5 
(since each misplaced tile moved exactly once which is the minimum number of steps required to solve)

Note that hfn_inversions(n) = 4

Since the heuristic overestimated the cost of the goal from a state n, it's not admissible.

% 8. Now suppose we would change the cost for sliding a tile to the
% left to 2 and leave all the other moves the same cost. Does this
% now affect the admissibility of the four heuristics? Again, which
% of them are admissible?

%%  - hfn_null
<8.1.1>
yes

<8.1.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]


%%  - hfn_misplaced
<8.2.1>
yes

<8.2.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]


%%  - hfn_manhattan
<8.3.1>
yes

<8.3.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]


%%  - hfn_inversions
<8.4.1>
yes

<8.4.2>
[if no explain in 100 words or less]

% 9. In the former modification (sliding to the LEFT costs 0.5), can
% you say for sure which heuristic will be the fastest (expand the
% least number of states) in finding a (not necessary optimal)
% solution? Explain.
<9.1>
yes

<9.2>
We know that for any node n, hfn_manhattan(n) is greater than or equal to hfn_misplaced(n), making it 
more dominate than hfn_misplaced. 
In the case of uniform cost of movement, hfn_manhattan and hsn_inversion have no real dominance relation.
But in the case of sliding to the left of cost 0.5, and that when a tile slides
to the left, hfn_inversion does not change, 
but hfn_manhattan will change and be smaller since the cost at each step will be minimum with added heuristic,
therefore, hfn_inversions dominates hfN_manhattan, so it expands less.

% 10. One can obtain another heuristic for the N-puzzle by relaxing the
% problem as follows: let's say that a tile can move from square A to
% square B if B is blank.  The exact solution to this problem defines
% Gaschnig's heuristic. Explain why Gaschnig's heuristic is at
% least as accurate as hfn_misplaced.  Show some cases where it
% is more accurate than both the hfn_misplaced} and 
% hfn_manhattan} heuristics.  Can you suggest a way to calculate
% Gaschnig's heuristic efficiently?

<10.1>
hfn_misplaced is the optimal solution for the problem where a tile can move from square A to square B. 
This is a relaxation of the original problem (a tile can move from A to B if B is blank), 
and Gaschnig's heuristic is the optimal solution for this original problem, Gaschnig's heuristic is at least 
as expensive as hfn_misplaced. Since Gaschnig's heuristic is also admissible because hfn_misplaced is to, 
Gaschnig's heuristic is therefore at least as accurate as hfn_misplaced.


<10.2>
If we switched two adjacent tiles from the goal state, we have a state where 

hfn_misplaced = hfn_manhattan = 2  (obviously),

but Gaschnig's heuristic = 3,
	this involves:
	(1)move one misplaced tile to blank 
	(2)move other tile to correct spot
	(3)move first tile to correct spot

		
<10.3>
To compute Gaschnig's heuristic, 
do the following until the goal state is reached: 

let B be the current location of the blank; 

if B is occupied by tile X (not blank) in the goal state, move X to B; 

else, move any misplaced tile to B. 


This is the optimal solution to the relaxed problem.
