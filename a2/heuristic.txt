			Heuristic Implementation
			

The definition of the heuristic is 
NumberP2Stones (Opponent) - NumberP1Stones (Human Player)

This heuristic is useful with respect that given a reasonable depth,
will ensure a move that will assuredly result in that player containing
the least number of stones on the field per turn, that being the goal 
of the game in the terminal state.

This heuristic mostly applies the principle of mobility in its decision. 
It's selection assures that the resulting state after his movement
will result in the minimal number of his stones and greater movement of his opponent. 
The player will essentially select a spot that is farthest away from the cluster of 
opponent stones so as to reduce the number of "flipped" opponent stones as much as 
possible to result in as few his stones as possible. This causes a "sparsing" of the 
layout of stones. As a result, there are more possible moves for the next player, 
including the possible moves of the original cluster and the possible moves of 
the sparse lineup of the original player, thereby increasing the mobility of the 
opponent, increasing the likeliness of flipping his opponent's stones.
